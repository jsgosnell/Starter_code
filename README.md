## Getting started

At this point I’m assuming you received an invitation to view an
assignment on github classroom and accepted it. You now have a private
repository of these files. This repository contains starter code for all
assignments.

### If you are using RStudio on your desktop, QUBES, or anywhere that looks like an RStudio screen

To start working on an assignment, open RStudio (on your desktop or
cloudserver where you actually see the main Rstudio screen).

Select file, new project, Version control. On the next screen select
git. If this isn’t available, you may need to install git (free) on your
system. You can download it at <https://git-scm.com/download/>.

Next you’ll need to enter the url for your repository. Look for the Code
button (usually green) in your githbub repository (where you may be
reading this…).

Click it, then copy the web url (or click the copy icon). Input that
into the Rstudio Repository URL space. Then name the project (maybe
Assignment 1,2, etc?). The Create project… field can be left blank to
just save all projects into the main directory. Alternatively you can
click Browse and make an Assignments folder if you want. Whatever you
choose, the project will be saved in new folder in that location using
the name you chose. Note you may need to enter your github username and
password to create the repository.

Go to the next section (**Now we can actually work in R**) to get
started

### If you are using Rstudio cloud…

You’ll instead see something like this:

To start working on an assignment, select **New Project**, **New Project
from Github repo**, then enter the url for your repository. Look for the
Code button (usually green) in your githbub repository (where you may be
reading this…).

![alt

Click it, then copy the web url (or click the copy icon). Input that
into the field asking for the URL of your github repository.

Note you may need to enter your github username and password to create
the repository.

The next screen will bring you to a “normal” RStudio screen.

## Now we can actually work in R

Now you can start working on the assignment in Rstudio. To view
instructions, open the .Rmd file you want to work on IN RSTUDIO\! It
will be in the folder for the assignment you are focusing on. From
inside thep project space, go to **File**, **Open File** and find it, or
look in the Files window to find and open the file.

Then **Knit** the file. Note the first time you do this in a project you
may be prompted to install a number of packages\! If you are using a
webservice you may also need to allow pop-ups in your browser.

The **Knit** button saves the file and shows you a rendered copy of the
contents of the editor.

Now you can start working on the assignment in Rstudio. To view
instructions, open the .Rmd file you want to workon IN RSTUDIO\! It will
be in the folder for the assignment you are focusing on. Then **Knit**
the file.

Presto\! You will see instructions. As you update the .Rmd file and
**Knit** it, it will update. Make sure you also save changes and
**Commit** and **Push** them back to the github clone\!

This is the file you will eventually turn in (a little meta…). You can
also view the instructions/assignment file on Github if you click on the
.md file in the folder associated with the assignment you are working
on.
